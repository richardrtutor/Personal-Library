# Personal Library

### - by Richard Tutor and Rylee Chisholm

## Description:
A library where you can:

- Log in, sign up, or log out
- Sort through books
- Create personal lists for books  
- The user is able to add books to the library 
- The user is also able to delete books from the library

## Why We Chose This: 
We wanted to try something different than a dungeon crawler this time around.  Something a bit more professional and appropriate for a work environment involving web and software development.  We felt the need to develop something that will be useful to us and our friends in the future.  Since many of our friends read books, the idea of a library came to us and we decided to create it.

## Core User Workflow: 
User logs in with password and is then able to sort through books via name, author, and genre.  Users can add or delete books from the library.  Users can create, delete, and edit tags/lists of books.  The user can end the program and have to log back in after restarting the program.

## Code Example:


    [Log In] or [Sign Up]
    > Log In
    Username: User
    Password: pswd
    What would you like to do? [add] a book, [delete] a book, [view] by, add a [tag], [Log Out], or [quit]
    > add
    Input Book Title or [back] to cancel: Fablehaven
